# VuelingChallenge

Develop an SPA in Angular > 4 that shows LaLiga statistics using the api provided in the project: 

	to run the api: npm run api

The aplication should start showing a list football teams.	
each club item will be clickcable.
when a club item is clicked this will show a new view with the list of players wich belongs to this club.
each player item has to show the name of the player.
When you click a player item, this will display a pop-up with the player's data (Name, Picture and market value in UE convention, Ex: 1.000.456,00) 

Do not focus your efforts in the UI or UX. The important part is the readability of the code, as well as the architecture and maintainability. 
The development of tests will be evaluated.

you can use Angular material (https://material.angular.io/) or any other libary to manage the UI.

feel free to update the angular version.
